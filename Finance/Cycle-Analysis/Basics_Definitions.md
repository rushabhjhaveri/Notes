# Cycle Analysis Basics & Definitions # 

Amplitude: Strength of the rising or declining phase of a cycle; the size [height] of a cycle as measured from inflection point to peak or valley 

Channel: The price action contained between two parallel lines in a trend; in a price channel, the lower line is the trend line drawn from a pivot low, connecting with other lows, and the upper line is the channel line drawn on pivot highs, connecting with other highs - the two lines of a channel represent support and resistance 

Component: A phase of a rising or declining price action that occur around the trend; a directional force acting on other components; a completed cycle that is a part of the sum of all cycles in an observation 

Crest [Peak]: The top price of the rising phase of a cycle 

Cycle: A cycle is an event which repeats itself on a regular basis; a complete repetition of a wave; where a point of observation returns to its origin 

Cycle, Idealized: Theoretical cycles that have equal length and peak at exactly the midpoint; the "cycle bracket" tool draws ideal cycles 

Cycle Length [Period]: Measurement from the point that a cycle begins repeating itself; measurement of the distance between troughs 

Damping: When amplitude of a cycle is minimized or disappears due to the effect of a more dominant cycle. Sometimes peaks and troughs are barely visible 

Dominance: The cycle that has the greatest effect on price action; this is most often the cycle with the longest length in an observation 

Envelope: Parallel lines, curved or straight, that contain most data points within a cycle; these may also be constructed of parallel moving averages relating to the high, low, or midpoint, etc.; these are similar to channels, yet may be shown as curved 

Frequency: How often the cycle fluctuates within a given time; the number of shorter cyclic components within a longer component; the reciprocal of the "period"; a ten day cycle has a frequency of 1/10 of a cycle per day 

Harmonics [Principal]: A larger cycle can be divided into two or three [or more] parts; i.e., a 54-week cycle is made up of two 27-week cycles, which is made up of 3-9 week cycles 

Inflection Point: Where the cycle line crosses the X-Axis 

Inversions: A rare occurrence; when a cycle high appears where there should be a cycle low and vice-versa; this can happen when a cycle high or low is skipped or is very small; a cycle low appears almost non-existent in a strong uptrend, because the longer-dominant cycle makes it nearly invisible; similarly, markets can fall fast and can make a high barely perceptible 

Proportionality [Principal]: Amplitude of a cycle tends to be proportional to the length; so a 20-period cycle will tend to have a price movement twice as large as a 10-period cycle 

Phase: The position of a cycle at a particular point in time; phases may be described as "rising", "declining", "peaking", or "bottoming", etc. 

Phase Difference [or Phase Shift]: The distance between two cycle's lengths measured at the peak or trough; two cycles that have the same length are parallel 

Nesting: When two or more cycles trough at the same [or similar] times 

Summation [Principal]: Cycles combining through simple additions; Hurst's "Principal of Summation"; the sum of all cycles equal the price action [as seen on the chart] 

Translation: The location of a cycle peak; left-hand-translation is peaking before the ideal peak [tends to be bearish]; right-hand-translation is peaking after the ideal peak [tends to be bullish] 

Trend: The relationship between peak and troughs; two consecutive higher highs and higher lows establishes a cyclical uptrend and vice-versa for down trends 

Trend Line: A line constructed of two or more points; these are often the troughs of cycles, defining the trend 

Trough [Low]: The low prices of the declining phase of a cycle 

Velocity: The rate of change within the particular phase of a cycle; cycles are considered to have the lowest speed as they come into the turns [peaks and troughs] and fastest as they accelerate away from the turns; speed zero at peak and trough
