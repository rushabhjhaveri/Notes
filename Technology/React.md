# React # 

_My notes from following the ReactJS Tutorial by Codevolution._

## What is React? ## 

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

There are two main points to note here:
* React is **not** a framework; it is a _library_. 
* React is only about one thing -- focus is on building _rich user interfaces_; does not concern itself with things such as routing and other functionalities. 

To address the concern regarding other functionalities, React works really well with other libraries which can be used in conjunction with React to build full-fledged web applications. 

## Why Learn React? ## 
There are several reasons why it would behoove one to learn React: 
* Created and maintained by Facebook: a lot of time, money, and development is being put into this platform, and is actively used by the tech giant for its products. 
* More than 100K starts on GitHub -- clearly people are taking notice. 
* Large developer/support community. 
* In-demand skillset -- check StackOverflow; increasingly becoming front-end tool of choice. 

## Key React Features & Usecases ## 
* Component-based architecture: the basic building blocks of React are known as _components_. 
* Reusable code: the concept of components allows gives rise to highly reusable code; components can be reused/tweaked to be used in different places as necessary. 
* Declarative nature:
    * React is a declarative library; you tell it what you want and React will build the actual UI [do not need to specify control flow]. 
    * Compare this to imperative libraries: control flow must be specified; must describe the algorithm step-by-step. 
* Efficient handling rendering/updating of components. 
* Gracefully handles DOM updates [usually a very expensive operation]. 
* Seamless integration with part or the whole of an application. 
* Stepping stone to React native [for mobile application development].
