## Securing Networks ## 

## Securing Network Devices ## 

Network devices include things like switches, routers, firewalls, and more 

Default Accounts: A user or administrator-level account that is installed on a device by the manufacturer during production 

Weak Passwords: A password should be long, strong, and complex; should require at least 14 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters 

Privilege Escalation: Occurs when a user is able to gain the rights of another user or administrator 

Backdoor: A way of bypassing normal authentication in a system 

An IPS, proper firewall configs, network segmentation, and firmware updates are the keys to having network security 

## Securing Network Media ## 

Network Media: Copper, fiber optic, and coaxial cabling used as the connectivity method in a wired network 

Electromagnetic Interference [EMI]: A disturbance that can affect electrical circuits, devices, and cables due to radiation or electromagnetic conduction 

EMI can be caused by TVs, microwaves, cordless phones, motors, and other devices 

Shielding the cables [STP] or the source can minimize EMI 

Radio Frequency Interference [RFI]: A disturbance that can affect electrical circuits, devices, and cables due to AM/FM transmissions or cell towers 

RFI causes more problems for wireless networks 

Crosstalk: Occurs when a signal transmitted on one copper wire creates an undesired effect on another wire 

UTP is used more commonly than STP [due to being cheaper] 

Data Emanation: The electromagnetic field generated by a network cable or device when transmitting 

Split the wires of a twisted-pair connection 

Protected Distribution System [PDS]: Secured system of cable management to ensure that the wired network remains free from eavesdropping, tapping, data emanations, and other threats 

## Securing WiFi Devices ## 

Service Set Identifier [SSID]: Uniquely identifies the network and is the name of the WAP used by clients 

Rogue Access Point: An unauthorized WAP or Wireless Router that allows access to the secure network 

Evil Twin: A rogue, counterfeit, and unauthorized WAP with the same SSID as the valid one 

## Wireless Encryption ## 

Encryption of data in transit is paramount to security 

Pre-Shared Key: Same encryption key is used by the access point and the client 

Wired Equivalent Privacy [WEP]: Original 802.11 wireless security standard that claims to be as secure as a wired network 

WEP's weakness is it's 24-bit IV [Initialization Vector] 

WiFi Protected Access [WPA]: Replacement for WEP, which uses TKIP, Message Integrity Check [MIC], and RC4 encryption 

WPA was flawed, so it was replaced by WPA2 

WiFi Protected Access Version 2 [WPA2]: 802.11i standard to provide better wireless security featuring AES with a 128-bit key, CCMP, and integrity checking 

In wireless encryption [as elsewhere], making operations easier reduces security 

WiFi Protected Setup [WPS]: Automated encryption setup for wireless networks at a push of a button, but is severely flawed and vulnerable 

Always disable WPS 

Encryption and VPNs are always a good idea 

## Wireless Access Points ## 

Wireless security also relies upon proper WAP placement 

Wireless B,G,N use a 2.4 GHz signal 

Wireless A,N,AC use a 5.0 GHz signal 

2.4GHz signals can travel further than 5GHz 

Jamming: Intentional radio frequency interference targeting one's wireless network to cause a denial of service connection 

Wireless site survey software and spectrum analyzers can help identify jamming and interference 

AP Isolation: Creates network segment for each client when it connects to prevent them from communicating with other clients on the network 

## Wireless Attacks ## 

War Driving: Act of searching for wireless networks by driving around until one finds them 

Attackers can use wireless survey or open source attack tools 

War Chalking: Act of physically drawing symbols in public places to denote the open, closed, and protected networks in range 

War chalking digitally is becoming more commonplace 

IV Attack: Occurs when an attacker observes the operation of a cipher being used with several different keys and finds a mathematical relationship between those keys to determine the cleartext data 

This [IV Attack] happened with WEP and makes it easy to crack 

WiFi Disassociation Attack: Attack that targets individual client connected to a network, forces it offline by deauthenticating it, and then captures the handshake when it reconnects 

Used as part of an attack on WPA/WPA2 

Brute Force Attack: Occurs when an attacker continually guesses a password until the correct one is found 

Brute force will always find the password ... eventually 

## WPA3 ## 

WPA3 was introduced in 2018 to strengthen WPA2 

WPA3 has an equivalent cryptographic strength of 192-bits in WPA3-Enterprise Mode 

WPA3-Enterprise Mode: Uses AES-256 encryption with SHA-384 hash for integrity checking 

WPA3-Personal Mode: Uses CCMP-128 as the minimum encryption required for secure connectivity 

The largest improvement in WPA3 is the removal of the Pre-Shared Key [PSK] Exchange 

Simultaneous Authentication of Equals [SAE]: A secure password-based authentication and password-authenticated key agreement method 

SAE provides forward secrecy 

[Perfect] Forward Secrecy: A feature of key agreement protocols [like SAE] that provides assurance that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised 

Forward secrecy process: 
* The AP and the client use a public key system to generate a pair of long-term keys 
* The AP and the client exchange a one-time use session key using a secure algorithm like Diffie-Hellman 
* The AP sends the client messages and encrypt them using the session key created in step two 
* Client decrypts the messages received using the same one-time use key 
* The process repeats for every message being sent, starting at step two to ensure forward secrecy 

## Other Wireless Technologies ## 

Bluejacking: Sending of unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones and tablets 

Bluesnarfing: Unauthorized access of information from a wireless device through a bluetooth connection 

Don't allow bluetooth devices to use default PINs for pairing 

Radio Frequency Identification [RFID]: Devices that use a radio frequency signal to transmit identifying information about the device or token holder 

RFID can operate from 10cm to 200m depending on the device 

Near Field Communication [NFC]: Allows two devices to transmit information when they are within close range through automated pairing and transmission 

NFC devices are operated within 4cm from each other
