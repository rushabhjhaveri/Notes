# Vulnerability Management # 

## Vulnerability Management ## 

Vulnerability Assessment: Seeks to identify any issues in a network, application, database, or other systems prior to it being used that might compromise the system 

Vulnerability assessments define, identify, and classify vulnerabilities within a system 

Vulnerability Management: Practice of finding and mitigating the vulnerabilities in computers and networks 

## Penetration Testing ## 

Penetration tests look at a network's vulnerabilities from the outside 

Pivot: Occurs when an attacker moves onto another workstation or user account 

Persistence: Ability of an attacker to maintain a foothold inside the compromised network 

A pentester can also simulate an insider threat 

## Training and Exercises ## 

Tabletop Exercise [TTX]: Exercise that uses an incident scenario against a framework of controls or a red team 

A tabletop exercise is a discussion of simulated emergency situations and security incidents 

Penetration Test: A test that uses active tools and security utilities to evaluate security by simulating an attack on a system to verify that a threat exists, actively test it, bypass security controls, and then finally exploit vulnerabilities on a given system 
* Test the system to discover vulnerabilities or prove security controls work 
* Examine the system to identify any logical weaknesses 
* Interview personnel to gather information 

A pentest must be properly scoped and resourced before it can begin 

Red Team: The hostile or attacking team in a penetration test or incident response exercise 

Blue Team: The defensive team in a penetration test or incident response exercise 

White Team: Staff administering, evaluating, and supervising a penetration test or incident response exercise 

## OVAL ## 

Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language [OVAL]: A standard designed to regulate the transfer of secure public information across networks and the Internet utilizing any security tools and services available  

OVAL is comprised of a language and an interpreter 

OVAL Language: An XML schema used to define and describe the information being created by OVAL to be shared among the various programs and tools 

OVAL Interpreter: A reference developed to ensure the information passed around by these programs complies with the OVAL schemas and definitions used by the OVAL language 

## Vulnerability Assessments ## 

Vulnerability Assessment: Baselining of the network to assess the current security state of computers, servers, network devices, and the entire network in general 

Network Mapping: Discovery and documentation of physical and logical connectivity that exists in the network 

Commercial and free network mapping software is available 

Vulnerability Scanning: A technique that identifies threats on the network without exploiting them 

Banner Grabbing: A technique used to gain information about servers and inventory the systems or services 

Network Sniffing: The process of finding and investigating other computers on the network by analyzing the network traffic or capturing the packets being sent 

Network sniffer, packet sniffing, and protocol analyzer can all conduct packet capture 

Protocol Analyzer: Software tool that allows for the capture, reassembly, and analysis of packets from the network 

## Password Analysis ## 

Password Analysis: A tool used to test the strength of one's passwords to ensure password policies are being followed 

Password Cracker: Uses comparative analysis to break passwords and systematically continues guessing until the password is determined 

Password Guessing: Occurs when a weak password is simply figured out by a person 

Dictionary Attack: Method where a program attempts to guess the password by using a list of possible passwords 

Brute-Force Attack: Method where a program attempts to try every possible combination until it cracks the password 

Increasing complexity exponentially increases the time required to brute-force a password 

Cryptanalysis Attack: Comparing a precomputed encrypted password to a value in a lookup table 

Rainbow Table: List of precomputed values used to more quickly break a password since values don't have to be calculated for each password being guessed 

Rubber Hose Attack: Attempt to crack a password by threatening or causing a person physical harm in order to make them tell you the password
