# Automation # 

## Workflow Orchestration ## 

Orchestration: The automation of multiple steps in a deployment process 

Orchestration is the automation of the automations 

Rapid Elasticity in cloud computing would not be possible without orchestration 

Types of orchestration: 
* Resource Orchestration 
* Workload Orchestration 
* Service Orchestration 

Third-party orchestration platform is protection from vendor lock-in 

## CI / CD ## 

Continuous Integration: A software development method where code updates are tested and committed to a development or build server/code repository rapidly 

Continuous integration can test and commit updates multiple times per day 

Continuous integration detects and resolves development conflicts early and often 

Continuous Delivery: A software development method where application and platform requirements are frequently tested and validatead for immediate validity 

Continuous Deployment: A software development method where application and platform updates are committed to production rapidly 

Continuous delivery focuses on automated testing of code in order to get it ready for release 

Continuous deployment focuses on automated testing and release of code in order to get it into the production environment more quickly 

## DevSecOps ## 

DevOps: An organizational culture shift that combines software development and systems operations by referring to the practice of integrating the two disciplines within a company 

Operations and developers can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably 

DevSecOps: A combination of software development, security operations, and systems operations by integrating each discipline with the others 

DevSecOps utilizes a shift-left mindset 

Advantages of DevSecOps: 
* Integrate security from the beginning 
* Test during and after development 
* Automate compliance checks 

## IAC ## 

Infrastructure as Code [IAC]: A provisioning architecture in which deployment of resources is performed by scripted automation and orchestration 

IAC allows for the use of scripted approaches to provisioning infrastructure in the cloud 

Robust orchestration can lower overall IT costs, speed up deployments, and increase security 

Snowflake Systems: Any system that is different in its configuration compared to a standard template within an infrastructure as code architecture 

Lack of consistency leads to security issues and inefficiencies in support 

Idempotence: A property of IaC that an automation or orchestration action always produces the same result, regardless of the component's previous state 

IaC uses carefully-developed and tested scripts and orchestration runbooks to generate consistent builds 

## Machine Learning ## 

Artificial Intelligence [AI]: The science of creating machines with the ability to develop problem solving and analysis strategies without significant human direction or intervention 

Machine Learning [ML]: A component of AI that enables a machine to develop strategies for solving a task given a labeled dataset where features have been manually identified but without further explicit instructions 

Machine learning is only as good as the datasets used to train it 

Artificial Neural Network [ANN]: An architecture of input, hidden, and output layers that can perform algorithmic analysis of a dataset to achieve outcome objectives 

A machine learning system adjusts its neural network to reduce errors and optimize objectives 

Deep Learning: A refinement of machine learning that enables a machine to develop strategies for solving a task given a labeled dataset and without further explicit instructions 

Deep learning uses complex classes of knowledge defined in relation to simpler classes of knowledge to make more informed determinations about an environment
