# Incident Response Procedures # 

## Incident Response Procedures ## 

Our systems will never be 100% secure 

Incident Response: A set of procedures that an investigator follows when examining a computer security incident 

Incident Management Program: Program consisting of the monitoring and detection of security events on a computer network and the execution of proper responses to those security events 

Identification: Process of recognizing whether an event that occurs should be classified as an incident 

Containment is focused on isolating the incident 

Recovery: Focused on data restoration, system repair, and re-enabling any servers or networks taken offline during the incident response 

## Incident Response Planning ## 

Incident Response Team: Key people that are available to respond to any incident that meets the severity and priority thresholds set out by the incident response plan 

One's CSIRT should be the single point of contact for security incidents and may be a part of the SOC or an independent team 

Teams must have a secure method of communication for managing incidents 

Out-of-Band Communication: Signals that are sent between two parties or two devices that are sent via a path or method different from that of the primary communication between the two parties or devices 

Maintain an up-to-date contact list 

Prevent unauthorized release of information outside the CSIRT 

Senior Leadership: Executives and managers who are responsible for business operations and functional areas 

Regulatory Bodies: Governmental organizations that oversee the compliance with specific regulations and laws 

Legal: The business or organization's legal counsel is responsible for mitigating risk from civil lawsuits 

Law Enforcement: May provide services to assist in incident handling efforts or to prepare for legal action against the attacker in the future 

The decision to involve law enforcement must be made by senior executives with guidance from legal 

Human Resources [HR]: Used to ensure no breaches of employment law or employee contracts is made during an incident response 

Public Relations [PR]: Used to manage negative publicity from a serious incident 

CSIRT will be asked for information regarding the estimated downtime, the scope of systems and data affected, and other relevant details 

## Investigative Data ## 

Security Information and Event Monitoring [SIEM]: A combination of different data sources into one tool that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware 

Log Files: A file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software runs, or messages between different users of a communication software 

syslog / rsyslog / syslog-ng: Three variations of syslog which all permit the logging of data from different types of systems in a central repository 

journalctl: A Linux command line utility used for querying and displaying logs from journald, the systemd logging service on Linux 

nxlog: A multi-platform log management tool that helps to easily identify security risks, policy breaches, or analyze operational problems in server logs, operation system logs, and application logs 

nxlog is a cross-platform, open-source tool that is similar to rsyslog or syslog-ng 

netflow: A network protocol system created by Cisco that collects active IP network traffic as it flows in or out of an interface, including its point of origin, destination, volume, and paths on the network 

sflow: Short for "sampled flow", it provides a means for exporting truncated packets, together with interface counters for the purpose of network monitoring 

Internet Protocol Flow Information Export [IPfix]: A universal standard of export for Internet Protocol flow information from routers, probes, and other devices that are used by mediation systems, accounting/billing systems, and network management systems, to facilitate services such as measurement, accounting and billing by defining how IP flow information is to be formatted and transferred from an exporter to a collector 

Metadata: Data that describes other data by providing an underlying definition or description by summarizing basic information about data that makes finding and working with particular instances of data easier 

## Forensic Procedures ## 

Written procedures ensure that personnel handle forensics properly, effectively, and in compliance with required regulations 

Identification: Ensure the scene is safe, secure the scene to prevent evidence contamination, and identify the scope of evidence to be collected 

Collection: Ensure authorization to collect evidence is obtained, and then document and prove the integrity of evidence as it is collected 

Analysis: Create a copy of evidence for analysis and use repeatable methods and tools during analysis 

Reporting: Create a report of the methods and tools used in the investigation and present detailed findings and conclusions based on the analysis 

Legal Hold: A process designed to preserve all relevant information when litigation is reasonably expected to occur 

A computer or server could be seized as evidence 

Appoint a liaison with legal knowledge and expertise who can be the point of contact with law enforcement 

Warning: Defense attorneys will try to use any deviation from these ethics as a reason to dismiss findings and analysis 

Timeline: A tool that shows the sequence of file system events within a source image in a graphical format 

Many forensics tools can generate a timeline based on evidence 

If a tool does not support it, one can create a sequence of events within a spreadsheet to serve as a timeline 

## Data Collection Procedures ## 

Create a forensic disk image of the data as evidence 

FTK and EnCase are popular forensic tools 

Data Acquisition: The method and security tools used to create a forensically sound copy of data from a source device, such as system memory or a hard disk 

Bring-Your-Own-Device [BYOD] policies complicate data acquisition since one may not be able to legally search or seize the device 

Some data can only be collected once the system is shut down or the power suddenly disconnected 

Analysts should always follow the order of volatility when collecting evidence 

Warning: While most of the Windows registry is stored on the disk, some keys [like HKLM\Hardware] are only stored in memory so one should analyze the Registry via a memory dump
