# Risk Assessments # 

## Risk Assessments ## 

Risk Assessments: A process used inside of risk management to identify how much risk exists in a given network or system 

Risk: The probability that a threat will be realized 

Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in the design or implementation of a system 

Threat: Any condition that could cause harm, loss, damage, or compromise to our information technology systems 

Threats are external and beyond one's control 

Risk Management is used to minimize the likelihood of a negative outcome from occurring 

Risk Avoidance: A strategy that requires stopping the activity that has risk or choosing a less risky alternative 

Risk Transfer: A strategy that passes the risk to a third party 

Risk Mitigation: A strategy that seeks to minimize the risk to an acceptable level 

Risk Acceptance: A strategy that seeks to accept the current level of risk and the costs associated with it if the risk were realized 

Residual Risk: The risk remaining after trying to avoid, transfer, or mitigate the risk 

## Qualitative Risk ## 

Qualitative analysis uses intuition, experience, and other methods to assign a relative value to risk 

Experience is critical in qualitative analysis 

## Quantitative Risk ## 

Quantitative analysis uses numerical and monetary values to calculate risk 

Quantitative analysis can calculate a direct cost for each risk 

Magnitude of Impact: An estimation of the amount of damage that a negative risk might achieve 

Single Loss Expectancy [SLE]: Cost associated with the realization of each individualized threat that occurs 
* Asset Value x Exposure Factor 

Annualized Rate of Occurrence [ARO]: Number of times per year that a threat is realized 

Annualized Loss Expectancy [ALE]: Expected cost of a realized threat over a given year 
* ALE = SLE x ARO 

Hybrid approaches that combine quantitative and qualitative analysis are commonly used 

## Methodologies ## 

Security Assessments: Verify that the organization's security posture is designed and configured properly to help thwart different types of attacks 

Assessments might be required by contracts, regulations, or laws 

Assessments may be active or passive 

Active Assessments: Utilize more intrusive techniques like scanning, hands-on testing, and probing of the network to determine vulnerabilities 

Passive Assessments: Utilize open source information, the passive collection and analysis of the network data, and other unobtrusive methods without making direct contact with the targeted systems 

Passive techniques are limited in the amount of detail they find 

## Security Controls ## 

Security Controls: Methods implemented to mitigate a particular risk 

Security controls are categorized as physical, technical, or administrative 

Physical Controls: Any security measures that are designed to deter or prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or the systems that contain it 

Technical Controls: Safeguards and countermeasures used to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks to our systems and information 

Administrative Controls: Focused on changing the behavior of people instead of removing the actual risk involved 

NIST categories are management, operational, and technical 

Management Controls: Security controls that are focused on decision-making and the management of risk 

Operational Controls: Focused on the things done by people 

Technical Controls: Logical controls that are put into a system to help secure it 

Preventative Controls: Security controls that are installed before an event happens and are designed to prevent something from occurring 

Detective Controls: Used during the event to find out whether something bad might be happening 

Corrective Controls: Used after an event occurs 

A single control can be categorized into multiple types or categories 

Compensating Control: Used whenever one can't meet the requirement for a normal control 

Residual risk not covered by a compensating control is an accepted risk 

## Types of Risk ## 

External Risk: Risks that are produced by a non-human source and are beyond human control 

Internal Risk: Risks that are formed within the organization, arise during normal operations, and are often forecastable 

Legacy Systems: An old method, technology, computer system, or application program which includes an outdated computer system still in use 

Multiparty Risk: A risk that refers to the connection of multiple systems or organizations with each bringing their own inherent risk[s] 

IP Theft: Risk associated with business assets and property being stolen from an organization in which economic damage, the loss of a competitive edge, or a slowdown in business growth occurs 

Software Compliance / Licensing: Risk associated with a company not being aware of what software or components are installed within it's network
