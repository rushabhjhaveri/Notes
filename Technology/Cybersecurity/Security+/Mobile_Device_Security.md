# Mobile Device Security # 

## Securing Wireless Devices ## 

WiFi Protected Access 2 [WPA2] is the highest level of wireless security 

WPA2 relies on AES for encryption 

Bluetooth pairing creates a shared link key to encrypt the connection 

Wired devices are almost always more secure than wireless ones 

## Mobile Malware ## 

Ensure mobile device is patched and updated 

Only install apps from the official App/Play Store 

Do not jailbreak/root device 

Don't use custom firmware of custom ROM 

## SIM Cloning & ID Theft ## 

SIM: Subscriber Identity Module -- integrated circuit that securely stores the international mobile subscriber identity [IMSI] number and its related key 

SIM Cloning: Allows two phones to utilize the same service and allows an attacker to gain access to the phone's data 

SIM v1 cards were easy to clone but newer SIM v2 cards are much harder 

Be careful where you post phone numbers 

## Bluetooth Attacks ## 

Bluejacking: Sending of unsolicited messaged to Bluetooth-enabled devices 

Bluesnarfing: Unauthorized access of information from a wireless device over a Bluetooth connection 

Bluejacking sends information to a device, whereas Bluesnarfing takes information from a device 

## Mobile Device Theft ## 

Always ensure device is backed up 

Don't try to recover device alone if it is stolen 

Remote Lock: Requires pin or password before someone can use the device 

Remote Wipe: Remotely erases the contents of the device to ensure the information is not recovered by the thief 

## Security of Apps ## 

Only install apps from official mobile stores 

Mobile Device Management: Centralized software solution that allows system administrators to create and enforce policies across its mobile devices 

Turn location services off to ensure privacy 

Geotagging: Embedding of the geolocation coordinates into a piece of data [i.e., a photo] 

Geotagging should be considered when developing an organization's security policies 

## BYOD ## 

BYOD introduces a lot of security issues to consider 

Storage Segmentation: Creating a clear separation between personal and company data on a single device 

CYOD: Choose Your Own Device 

MDM can prevent certain applications from being installed on the device 

Ensure organizations have good security policies for mobile devices
