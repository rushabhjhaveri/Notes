# Malware # 

## Malware ## 

Malware: Software desgined to infiltrate a computer system and possibly damage it without the user's knowledge or consent 

Can be: viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, rootkits, spam 

## Viruses ## 

Virus: Malicious code that runs on a machine without the user's knowledge and infects the computer when executed 

Viruses require a user action in order to reproduce and spread 

Types of viruses: 
* Boot sector: Boot sector viruses are stored in the first sector of a hard drive and are loaded into memory upon boot up  
* Macro: Virus embedded into a document and is executed when the document is opened by the user  
* Program: Program viruses infect an executable or an application  
* Multipartite: Virus that combines boot and program viruses to first attach itself to the boot sector and system files before attacking other files on the computer  
* Encrypted: Encrypted viruses use a cipher to encrypt its contents to avoid detection 
* Polymorphic: Advanced version of an encrypted virus that changes itself every time it is executed by altering the decryption module to avoid detection  
* Metamorphic: Virus that is able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect a file [advanced version of polymorphic virus]  
* Stealth: Category of a virus protecting itself; viruses that use a variety of techniques to shield themselves from detection  
* Armored: Armored viruses have a layer of protection to confuse a program or person analyzing it  
* Hoax: Not a virus; techniques to trick users into believing their systems have been infected  

## Worms ## 

Worm: Malicious software, like a virus, but is able to replicate itself without user interaction 

Worms self-replicate and spread without a user's consent or action 

Worms can cause disruption to normal network traffic and computing activities 

## Trojans ## 

Trojan Horse: Malicious software that is disguised as a piece of harmless or desirable software 

Trojans perform desired functions and malicious functions 

Remote Access Trojan [RAT]: Provides the attacker with remote control of a victim computer and is the most commonly used type of trojan 

## Ransomware ## 

Ransomware: Malware that restricts access to a victim's computer system until a ransom is received 

Ransomware uses a vulnerability in a system to gain access and then encrypts the system's files

## Spyware ## 

Malware that secretly gathers information about the user without their consent 

Captures keystrokes made by the victim and takes screenshots that are sent to the attacker 

Adware displays advertisements based upon its spying on you 

Grayware: Software that isn't benign nor malicious and tends to behave improperly without serious consequences 

## Rootkits ## 

Rootkit: Software designed to gain administrative level control over a system without detection 

DLL injection is commonly used by rootkits to maintain their persistent control 

DLL Injection: Malicious code is inserted into a running process on a Windows machine by taking advantage of Dynamic Link Libraries that are loaded at runtime 

Driver Manipulation: An attack that relies on compromising the kernel-mode device drivers that operate at a privileged or system level 

A shim is placed between two components to intercept calls and redirect them 

Rootkits are activated before booting the operating system and are difficult to detect 

## Spam ## 

Spam: Activity that abuses electronic messaging systems, most commonly through email 

Spammers often exploit a company's open mail relays to send their messages
