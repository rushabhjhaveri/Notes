# Policies and Procedures # 

## Policies and Procedures ## 

Governance provides a comprehensive security management framework 

Policies: Defines the role of security in an organization and establishes the desired end state of the security program 

Policies are very broad 

Organizational Policies: Provide general direction and goals, a framework to meet the business goals, and define the roles, responsibilities, and terms 

System-Specific Policies: Address the security needs of a specific technology, application, network, or computer system 

Issue-Specific Policies: Built to address a specific security issue, such as email privacy, employee termination procedures, or other specific issues 

Policies may be regulatory, advisory, or informative 

Standards are used to implement a policy in an organization 

Baseline: Created as reference points which are documented for use as a method of comparison during an analysis conducted in the future 

Guidelines are used to recommend actions 

Procedures: Detailed, step-by-step instructions that are created to ensure personnel can perform a given action 

## Data Classifications ## 

 Data Classification: Category based on the value to the organization and the sensitivity of the information if it were to be disclosed 

 Sensitive Data: Any information that can result in a loss of security, or loss of advantage to a company, if accessed by unauthorized persons 

 Commercial businesses and the government use different classification systems 

 Commercial Classifications: Public, Sensitive, Private, and Confidential 

 Public Data: Has no impact to the company if released and is often posted in the open-source environment 

 Sensitive data might have a minimal impact if released 

 Private Data: Contains data that should only be used within the organization 

 Confidential Data: Highest classification level that contains items such as trade secrets, intellectual property data, source code, and other types that would seriously affect the business if disclosed 

 Government Classifications: Unclassified, Sensitive but Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret 

 Unclassified data can be released to the public 

 Sensitive But Unclassified: Items that wouldn't hurt national security if released, but could impact those whose data is contained in it 

 Confidential Data: Data that could seriously affect the government if unauthorized disclosure were to happen 

 Secret Data: Data that could seriously damage national security if disclosed 

 Top Secret Data: Data that could gravely damage national security if it were known to those who are not authorized for this level of information 

 Data should not be stored forever 

 ## Data Ownership ## 

 Data Ownership: The process of identifying the person responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of information assets 

 Data Owner: A senior [executive] role with ultimate responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset 

 The data owner is responsible for labeling the asset and ensuring that it is protected with appropriate controls 

 Data Steward: A role focused on the quality of the data and the associated metadata 

 Data Custodian: A role responsible for handling the management of the system on which the data assets are stored 

 Privacy Officer: A role responsible for the oversight of any PII/SPI/PHI assets maintained by the company 

 ## PII and PHI ## 

 It is corporate responsibility to protect the data collected 

 Personal Identifiable Information [PII]: A piece of data that can be used either by itself or in combination with some other pieces of data to identify a single person 

 Verify with legal team what is considered PII 

 Privacy Act of 1974: Affects U.S. government computer systems that collect, store, use, or disseminate PII 

 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]: Affects healthcare providers, facilities, insurance companies, and medical data clearing houses 

 Sarbanes-Oxley [SOX]: Affects publicly-traded U.S. corporations and requires certain accounting methods and financial reporting requirements 

 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act [GLBA]: Affects banks, mortgage companies, loan officies, insurance companies, investment companies, and credit card providers 

 Federal Information Security Management [FISMA] Act of 2002: Requires each agency to develop, document, and implement agency-wide information systems security program to protect their data 

 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard [PCI DSS] is a contractual obligation 

 Help America Vote Act [HAVA] of 2002: Provides regulations that govern the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information collected, stored, or processed during the election and voting process 

 SB 1386 requires any business that stores personal data to disclose a breach 

 ## Legal Requirements ## 

 Any type of information or asset should consider how a compromise of that information can threaten the three core security attributes of the CIA triad 

 Security controls focus on the CIA attributes of the processing system 

 Privacy: A data governance requirement that arises when collecting and processing personal data to ensure the rights of the subject's data 

 Legal requirements will affect corporate governance and policies in regards to privacy of users' data 

 General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]: Personal data cannot be collected, processed, or retained without the individual's informed consent 

 GDPR also provides the right for a user to withdraw consent, to inspect, amend, or erase data held about them 

 GDPR requires data breach notification within 72 hours 

 Warning: Data breaches can happen accidentally or through malicious interference 

 ## Privacy Technologies ## 

 Deidentification: Methods and technologies that remove identifying information from data before it is distributed 

 Deidentification is often implemented as part of a database design 

 Data Masking: A deidentification method where generic or placeholder labels are substituted for real data while preserving the structure or format of the original data 

 Tokenization: A deidentification method where a unique token is substituted for real data 

 Aggregation/Banding: A deidentification technique where data is generalized to protect the individuals involved 

 Reidentification: An attack that combines a deidentified data set with other data sources to discover how secure the deidentification method used is 

 ## Security Policies ## 

 Privacy policies govern the labeling and handling of data 

 Acceptable Use Policy: Defines the rules that restrict how a computer, network, or other systems may be used 

 Change Management Policy: Defines the structured way of changing the state of a computer system, network, or IT procedure 

 Separation of Duties is a preventative type of administrative control 

 Job Rotation: Different users are trained to perform the tasks of the same position to help prevent and identify fraud that could occur if only one employee had the job 

 Onboarding and Offboarding Policy: Dictates what type of things need to be done when an employee is hired, fired, or quits 

 Terminated employees are often not cooperative 

 Due Diligence: Ensuring IT infrastructure risks are known and managed properly 

 Due Care: Mitigation actions that an organization takes to defend against the risks that have been uncovered during due diligence 

 Due Process: A legal term that refers to how an organization must respect and safeguard personnel's rights 

 Due process protects citizens from their government and companies from lawsuits 

 ## User Education ## 

 Security Awareness Training: Used to reinforce to users the importance of their help in securing the organization's valuable resources 

 User security awareness training has the best return on investment 

 Security Training: Used to teach the organization's personnel the skills they need to perform their job in a more secure manner 

 Security education is generalized training [like Security+] 

 Specialized training may be developed too 

 ## Vendor Relationships ## 

 Non-Disclosure Agreement [NDA]: Agreement between two parties that defines what data is considered confidential and cannot be shared outside of the relationship 

 NDAs are a binding contract 

 Memorandum of Understanding [MOU]: A non-binding agreement between two or more organizations to detail an intended common line of action 

 MOUs can be between multiple organizations 

 Service-Level Agreement [SLA]: An agreement concerned with the ability to support and respond to problems within a given timeframe and continuing to provide the agreed upon level of service to the user 

 Interconnection Security Agreement [ISA]: An agreement for the owners and operators of the IT systems to document what technical requirements each organization must meet 

 Business Partnership Agreement [BPA]: Conducted between two business partners that establishes the conditions of their relationship 

 A BPA can also include security requirements 

 ## Disposal Policies ## 

 Asset disposal occurs whenever a system is no longer needed 

 Degaussing: Exposes the hard drive to a powerful magnetic field which in turn causes previously-written data to be wiped from the drive 

 Purging [Sanitizing]: Act of removing data in such a way that it cannot be reconstructed using any known forensic techniques 

 Clearing: Removal of data with a certain amount of assurance that it cannot be reconstructed 

 Data remnants are a big security concern 

 Possible reuse of the device will influence the disposal method 

 ## IT Security Frameworks ## 

 Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture [SABSA] is a risk-driven architecture 

 Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology [COBIT]: A security framework that divides IT into four domains: Plan & Organize, Acquire & Implement, Deliver & Support, and Monitor & Evaluate 

 NIST SP 800-53 is a security control framework developed by the Dept. of Commerce 

 ITIL is the defacto standard for IT Service Management 

 ## Key Frameworks ## 

 Center for Information Security [CIS]: Consensus-developed secure configuration guidelines for hardening [benchmarks] and prescriptive, prioritized, and simplified sets of cybersecurity best practices [configuration guides] 

 Risk Management Framework [RMF]: A process that integrates security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle through an approach to security control selection and specification that considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations 

 Cybersecurity Framework [CSF]: A set of industry standards and best practices created by NIST to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks 

 ISO 27001: An international standard that details requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system [ISMS] 
 
 ISO 27002: An international standard that provides best practice recommendations on information security controls for use by those responsible for initiating, implementing, or maintaining information security management systems [ISMS]

 ISO 31000: An international standard for enterprise risk management that provides a universally recognized paradigm for practitioners and companies employing risk management processes to replace the myriad of existing standards, methodologies, and paradigms that differed between industries, subject matters, and regions 

 System and Organization Controls [SOC]: A suite of reports produced during an audit which is used by service organizations to issue validated reports of internal controls over those information systems to the users of those services 

 SOC2 - Trust Services Criteria 

 Type II - Addresses the operational effectiveness of the specified controls over a period of time [usually 9-12 months] 

 Cloud Security Alliance's Cloud Control Matrix: Designed to provide fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors and to assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of a cloud provider 

 Cloud Security Alliance's Reference Architecture: A methodology and a set of tools that enable security architects, enterprise architects, and risk management professionals to leverage a common set of solutions that fulfill their common needs to be able to assess where their internal IT and their cloud providers are in terms of security capabilities and to plan a roadmap to meet the security needs of their business
