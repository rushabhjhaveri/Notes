# ES6 & TypeScript # 

_My notes from following the ES6 and TypeScript Tutorial by Codevolution._ 

## ES5 ## 
* JavaScript -- based on a standard implementation called ECMA Script. 
* The version of ECMA Script that was being used was Version 5 [ergo, ES5]. 

## ES6 ## 
* ECMA Script 2015 was a major update to ES5. 
* It brought a lot of new features to the table, and is colloquially known as ES6. 

## TypeScript ## 
* TypeScript is a free, open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. 
* It is a typed subset of JS that compiles to plain JS and contains features of ES5 and ES6. 
* TypeScript, as the name suggests, implements types (numbers, strings, etc.) in JS, but their use is completely optional. 
* Using TS/the implementing types enables one to write safer, bug-free code. 

## Transpilers ## 
ES6 ships with a lot of new features.  
However, not all browsers have all these features implemented.  
* Chrome and Firefox led the pack post-launch in terms of percentage of features implemented.  
* With time, browsers moved towards implementing all the available features.  

This is where a transpiler comes in handy.  
* Will use a transpiler to transpile ES6 code into ES5 code which does run on all browsers.  
* Examples of transpilers: babel, traceur  
* However, we will be using TypeScript as the transpiler.
