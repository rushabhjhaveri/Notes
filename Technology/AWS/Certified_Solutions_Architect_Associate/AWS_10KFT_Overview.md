# AWS - 10,000-Foot Overview # 

AWS - High Level Services [similar to the higher level view covered in Certified Cloud Practitioner] 

## AWS Global Infrastructure ## 
19 Regions, 57 Availability Zones as of December 2018

5 more Regions and 15 more AZ's planned for 2019

Think of an AZ as a data center 

A data center is just a building filled with servers 

An _Availability Zone_ may actually be _several_ data centers, but because they are close together, they are counted as one AZ 

A _Region_ is a geographical area 

Each Region consists of two [or more] AZ's 

_Edge Locations_ are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content - typically, this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network [CDN] 

There are many more Edge Locations than Regions 

There are currently over 150 Edge Locations
