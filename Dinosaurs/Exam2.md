# Dinosaurs Exam 2 # 

Early Reptiles: Small bodied, five-fingered forelimbs, small skull, short jaw, neck joint for swiftness

Paleozoic Plant Ecology: Swamps with mosses and seed ferns; forests with seed ferns, cycads, and conifers

Tetrapod Limb Morphology: The process that many different animals have similar limb structures (one bone coming off the arm (upper) becomes two (lower), becomes many (terminus)) 

Forelimb Bones: upper: humerus, lower: radius+ulna, hinge: wrist, terminus: carpals-metacarpals-phalanges

Hindlimb Bones: upper: femur, lower: tibia+fibula, hinge:ankle, terminus: tarsals-metatarsals-phalanges

Reptile vs Amphibian Characteristics: in reptiles a much more solidly connected vertebral column and more powerful limb skeletons than we do in amphibians; reptiles can lay eggs on land

Advantages of Amniotic Egg

Thermoregulation: Enzymes work in a specific temperature range. Small bodied reptiles can heat themselves very quickly but lose heat quickly. Large bodied reptiles take a long time to reach temperature but lose heat very slowly.

Anapsids: No hole in skull behind orbit (temporal fenestrae)

Synapsids: One lateral temporal fenestrae (on the side of skull); Found in pelycosaurs, therapsids, and mammals

Diapsids: Two temporal fenestrae (lateral [side of skull] and dorsal [top of skull]); Found in dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and all living amniotes except mammals

Pelycosaurs: Name for all early synapsids; Had powerful chewing muscles anchored to lateral temporal fenestrae; Herbivores

Archosauromorph: Diapsid skull with additional antorbital fenestra (in front of orbit) and mandibular fenestrae (in the jaw), Serrated teeth (laterally compressed), Sprawling, Semi-erect/upright or Fully-erect/upright posture; include crocodiles, birds, alligators, Pterosauria, Dinosauria, and Ichthyosaurus

Lepidosauromorphs: Living lizards and snakes, and their ancestors

Sprawling posture: Upper limbs are horizontal and lower limbs are vertical; Similar to modern crocodiles; 
Angle between upper & lower limb = 90 degrees; S-shaped upper limb bone; No ball head on upper; socket joint; Short lower limb bones; Bent ankle hinge

Semi-erect/ upright posture: Upper limbs are at an angle with the lower limbs coming down off of them
Modern day komodo dragons; Angle between upper & lower limb is obtuse, > 90
Fully-erect/upright posture: Upper and lower limbs are straight down beneath the body; Modern cows; Angle between upper & lower limb bones = 180 degrees; Straight upper limb bone; Ball head on upper socket joint; Long lower limb bone; Straight ankle hinge

Plantigrade: type of fully erect posture; walk on sole of the foot (ankle is near ground) 

Digitigrade: type of fully erect posture; walk on the toes (ankle is elevated off ground)

Bent ankle hinge: Curved hinge path, Allows twisting motion; Stabilizes foot in sprawling postures
Straight ankle hinge: Advanced Mesotarsal (AM); Straight hinge path, Allows swing motion (back and forth); Good for speedy, upright walking and running

Saurischians: have "Lizard hips"

Ornithischians: have "Bird hips"

Herrerasauridae (meaning Herrera’s Lizard): Oldest known and one of the 1st dinosaurs; very primitive; close relatives to Theropods; founded by farmer in Argentina; small-medium carnivores; did have lizard-hip, but lacked other features to be considered true dino; five fingers, claws, short forearms, fast runners

Sauropoda (meaning lizard-footed): Largest land animals; Up to 55 tons in body weight; Over 40 meters in body length; High diversity; up to 75 genera; Early Jurassic Period - end of Cretaceous Period; Obligatory quadrupeds, Walked on tips of of toes w/ heels; resting on large pads; Tree-top feeders; Egg-laying; herd animals

Theropoda: bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs, with birdlike legs and necks; theropoda means “beast feet”, a rather inappropriate name; "bird(-like) feet" would have been better. Included in this group are both small forms (among them the ancestors of birds) and large predators such as Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Theropods had the largest and most sophisticated brains of any known dinosaurs. 

Diplodocidae (meaning ("double beams"): were Late Jurassic sauropods. their skulls were long and slender with elongated muzzles; bodies were long and relatively lightly built

"Lizard hips": Three bones radiate from acetabulum in three different directions

Fabroauridae (meaning "Fabre's lizard" in honor of Jean Fabre): Herbivore; Lived in early Jurassic.; First of the Ornithischian Dinosaurs ("Pre-ornithopod).; Very small (modern cat size).; Recessed tooth row.; Cheeks (way to process food in mouth)

Thyreophora (meaning shield bearers): ornithischian (bird-hipped) armored dinosaurs, living from the early Jurassic until the end of the Cretaceous.'; quadripedal, herbivore

Ornithopoda: (meaning "Bird feet") are a suborder of ornithischian dinosaurs that had a beak, a two-legged walk or a two-legged and four-legged walk, and no body armor. These plant-eating dinosaurs lived from the late Triassic period until the Cretaceous period.

Marginocephalia: ("fringed heads") are a clade of extinct herbivorous dinosaurs that inherited a slight shelf or frill (a shelf of bone projecting from the back of the skull). Bipedal and Quadrupedal
ex triceratops

Ceratosauria (meaning "horned lizard"): meaning "horned lizard", in reference to the horn on its nose, large jaws with blade-like teeth, a large, blade-like horn on the snout and a pair of hornlets over the eyes. The forelimbs were powerfully built but very short. bird hips bipedal

Megalosauridae (meaning "great lizard"): large theropods with large skulls with a powerful bite, strong legs, and three-fingered hands. carnivorous and bipedal

Allosauridae: family of bipedal theropod dinosaurs that lived in the late Jurassic period.; They were medium to large carnivorous dinosaurs, with large, crested skulls and three-fingered hands,

Ornithomimosauridae (meaning "bird-mimic lizards"): ("bird-mimic lizards") or ostrich dinosaurs[7] were theropod dinosaurs which bore a superficial resemblance to modern ostriches. They were fast, omnivorous or herbivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period; The fore limbs ("arms") were long and slender and bore powerful claws. The hind limbs were long and powerful, with a long foot and short, strong toes terminating in hooflike claws.; had toothless beaks and feathers

Tyrannosauridae: large bipedal carnivores with massive skulls filled with large teeth. Despite their large size, their legs were long and proportioned for fast movement. In contrast, their arms were very small, bearing only two functional digits.; thick, S-shaped neck, and a long, heavy tail acted as a counterweight to balance out the head and torso, with the center of mass over the hips.

Oviraptors (meaning "The Egg Snatchers"): "The Egg Snatchers"; Oviraptors are some of the strangest-looking theropods. They were a very rare group of maniraptorans that are well represented by excellent fossil from the Cretaceous period.; most distinguishing characteristic us a toothless jaw which formed a massive beak. Their jaws were well-muscled and adept at crushing. They are distinguished from the toothless ornithomimosaurs by the development of a massive beak and the highly specific in configuration and structure of the lower jaw with the characteristic articular joint.; The name "oviraptor" (egg snatcher) is a misnomer; their jaws are not useful for eating eggs, but for crushing very hard food.

Troodontidae: bird-like theropods, They were small (about the size of a small adult human), with long and slender hind limbs useful for rapid locomotion, and a long skull filled with distinctive recurved and saw-edged teeth . very smart; a rare and small subgroup of maniraptors

Dromaeosauridae: small to medium-sized feathered carnivores that flourished in the Cretaceous Period. aka raptors; small (wolf-sized) to large (up to 30 feet long!) theropods which had specialized features such as a well-developed slashing talon on their second pedal phalanx (toe) (pictured below), a stiffened tail which possibly functioned as a dynamic stabilizer, and large grasping manus (hands). They were well-equipped with claws, muscular toothy jaws, and agile bodies.

Coelurosauria (meaning "hollow tailed lizards" ): meaning "hollow tailed lizards" is the clade containing all theropod dinosaurs more closely related to birds than to carnosaurs.; Enlarged brains, Long slender tridactyl manus, Kayak-shaped chevrons making the distal part of the tail particularly slender, Long narrow metatarsals

Prosauropoda: before the lizard-footed', were a genus of early herbivourous dinosaurs that lived during the Triassic and early Jurassic periods.; long neck, small skull, serrated teeth; depressed jaw hinge

Titanosauridae: nostrils were large ('macronarian') and they all had crests formed by these nasal bones. Their teeth were either somewhat spatulate (spoon-like) or like pegs or pencils, but were always very small.; many titanosaur species was armored with a small mosaic of small, bead-like scales around a larger scale.; Their necks were of average length, for sauropods, and their tails were whip-like

Camarasauridae: sauropods, forelimbs about same height as hind limbs

Brachiosauridae: family of herbivorous, quadrupedal sauropod dinosaurs. Brachiosaurids had long necks that enabled them to access the leaves of tall trees that other sauropods would have been unable to access.; possessed thick spoon-shaped teeth which helped them to consume tough plants more efficiently than other sauropods. They have also been characterized by a few unique unambiguous synapomorphies; dorsal vertebrae with 'rod-like' transverse processes and an ischium with an abbreviate pubic peduncle.

"Bird hips": Pubis is parallel to the ischium
