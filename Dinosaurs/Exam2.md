# Dinosaurs Exam 2 # 

Early Reptiles: Small bodied, five-fingered forelimbs, small skull, short jaw, neck joint for swiftness

Paleozoic Plant Ecology: Swamps with mosses and seed ferns; forests with seed ferns, cycads, and conifers

Tetrapod Limb Morphology: The process that many different animals have similar limb structures (one bone coming off the arm (upper) becomes two (lower), becomes many (terminus)) 

Forelimb Bones: upper: humerus, lower: radius+ulna, hinge: wrist, terminus: carpals-metacarpals-phalanges

Hindlimb Bones: upper: femur, lower: tibia+fibula, hinge:ankle, terminus: tarsals-metatarsals-phalanges

Reptile vs Amphibian Characteristics: in reptiles a much more solidly connected vertebral column and more powerful limb skeletons than we do in amphibians; reptiles can lay eggs on land

Advantages of Amniotic Egg

Thermoregulation: Enzymes work in a specific temperature range. Small bodied reptiles can heat themselves very quickly but lose heat quickly. Large bodied reptiles take a long time to reach temperature but lose heat very slowly.

Anapsids: No hole in skull behind orbit (temporal fenestrae)

Synapsids: One lateral temporal fenestrae (on the side of skull); Found in pelycosaurs, therapsids, and mammals

Diapsids: Two temporal fenestrae (lateral [side of skull] and dorsal [top of skull]); Found in dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and all living amniotes except mammals

Pelycosaurs: Name for all early synapsids; Had powerful chewing muscles anchored to lateral temporal fenestrae; Herbivores

Archosauromorph: Diapsid skull with additional antorbital fenestra (in front of orbit) and mandibular fenestrae (in the jaw), Serrated teeth (laterally compressed), Sprawling, Semi-erect/upright or Fully-erect/upright posture; include crocodiles, birds, alligators, Pterosauria, Dinosauria, and Ichthyosaurus

Lepidosauromorphs: Living lizards and snakes, and their ancestors

Sprawling posture: Upper limbs are horizontal and lower limbs are vertical; Similar to modern crocodiles; 
Angle between upper & lower limb = 90 degrees; S-shaped upper limb bone; No ball head on upper; socket joint; Short lower limb bones; Bent ankle hinge

Semi-erect/ upright posture: Upper limbs are at an angle with the lower limbs coming down off of them
Modern day komodo dragons; Angle between upper & lower limb is obtuse, > 90
Fully-erect/upright posture: Upper and lower limbs are straight down beneath the body; Modern cows; Angle between upper & lower limb bones = 180 degrees; Straight upper limb bone; Ball head on upper socket joint; Long lower limb bone; Straight ankle hinge

Plantigrade: type of fully erect posture; walk on sole of the foot (ankle is near ground) 

Digitigrade: type of fully erect posture; walk on the toes (ankle is elevated off ground)

Bent ankle hinge: Curved hinge path, Allows twisting motion; Stabilizes foot in sprawling postures
Straight ankle hinge: Advanced Mesotarsal (AM); Straight hinge path, Allows swing motion (back and forth); Good for speedy, upright walking and running

Saurischians: have "Lizard hips"

Ornithischians: have "Bird hips"

Herrerasauridae (meaning Herreraâ€™s Lizard): Oldest known and one of the 1st dinosaurs; very primitive; close relatives to Theropods; founded by farmer in Argentina; small-medium carnivores; did have lizard-hip, but lacked other features to be considered true dino; five fingers, claws, short forearms, fast runners

Sauropoda (meaning lizard-footed): Largest land animals; Up to 55 tons in body weight; Over 40 meters in body length; High diversity; up to 75 genera; Early Jurassic Period - end of Cretaceous Period; Obligatory quadrupeds, Walked on tips of of toes w/ heels; resting on large pads; Tree-top feeders; Egg-laying; herd animals
